# Come Make a Map

## Completely Custom, Open Source Maps with TileMill

This is supporting material for a presentation given by @incanus at [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org) 2013 in Portland, Oregon, on [TileMill](http://tilemill.com) by [MapBox](http://mapbox.com). 

> Map making doesn't have to be hard. Anyone can do it. And we'll show you how, using the open source design studio TileMill. Come make a map!

> Using the free, open source design studio TileMill, we’ll walk through what actually goes into making a map — from found sources of data to creating your own. Then, we’ll style them using CartoCSS, a CSS-like language for instantly styling map data. We’ll talk about design issues that go into making good maps. And lastly, we’ll talk about how to take your map and do whatever you like with it, whether it’s putting it on the web, into a mobile app, or sharing the data with others. You can even follow along on your laptop and end up with your own map!
